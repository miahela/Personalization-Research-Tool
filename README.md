At that time, I  funneled my earnings into the creation of an Internet of Things company,  but numerous factors lead to its demise after 2 hard fought years.  \n\nAt 31, I was penny-less, had a baby on the way, and had zero job  prospects (despite applying to 150 companies). My desperate situation  led me to take a job at Best Buy for $12 an hour while reinventing  myself through the completion of an MBA at the University of Colorado,  and a 6-month software development boot camp. \n\nAfter graduation, I  landed at American Express as a Senior Product Manager and then got  poached by Amazon in 2017 (because of my LinkedIn profile). My journey  has led to a deep sense of perspective, humility, and purpose that I  draw on to help others find clarity, meaning, and happiness in their  careers and lives. \n\nCheck out my website for details on my Mindset  Reset Podcast, Public Speaking, Consulting, or my free 40 page LinkedIn  guide\n\nhttp://www.johnraphaelmarty.com/\n\nFAQ\u0027s\n\nQ: Can you  speak at my Company, University, event or podcast?\nA: I\u0027d love to!
