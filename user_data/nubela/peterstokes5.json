I have had the pleasure of working with him at SAP. Peter comes to the table tremendous ideas and suggestions for customers, which stem from the amount of effort he puts in to preparing for the meetings. He thoroughly understands a company's needs and is able to anticipate the questions that arise while always ready with a well thought out answer. What gets Peter excited is his team's success. Earlier on in my role, Peter extended a helping hand; offering tips to coach and guide me to quickly develop in my position. Not only is he a great team player, he's quite the talent in running hockey pools! Peter would be an excellent asset and mentor on any team.
