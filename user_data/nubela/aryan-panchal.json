I came to Canada 3 years ago with no work experience, and no communication skills, and was filled with self-doubt. I was scared to talk to people and insecure about who I was. \n\nBut, I had a vision that I wanted to make an impact in this world, and hence began my journey. I started my first work experience working at a few different restaurants as a host and server to improve my communication skills and get over the fear of talking to people. As time went on, I developed my skills and started attending networking events - this is when everything changed! \n\nIn the last 3 years, I've had 15+ jobs in the business field and I got most of my jobs through unconventional job search methods. I rarely applied to any of the jobs I got!\n\nBut in May 2022, I was forced to take a break from university for 16 months because I didn't have enough money to go back to university. I did 4 internships in 16 months and 5 other part-time jobs at the same time to save up money. \n\n\nIn the last 3 years, I have focused on 3 things:\n\n1) Networking & Building Relationships\n2) Developing & Improving Myself\n3) Finding Opportunities in my Field \n\nWhat do I do right now?\n\nI am currently a full-time student, working full-time at one of the fastest-growing start-ups in Canada, creating my start-up focused on helping job seekers, created a student club at UofC focused on product management, mentoring and coaching people on mastering the art of job-seeking, and raising awareness about job search strategies on LinkedIn! \n\nNow I am on a mission to help others explore unconventional strategies for finding a job. \n\nAre you looking to master the art of job seeking?
