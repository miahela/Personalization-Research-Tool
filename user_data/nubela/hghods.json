Hugh has a charm and natural way about him that displays respect, empathy, and  builds confidence and trust with his customers and colleagues.   In the years  since we worked together, I have bumped into Hugh at conferences, usually joined by some of his reps.   As a manager, he has been consistent with these qualities, that have translated into great success as a Sales management leader. ","Jim Chakos\n\n\n\nHugh is one of the best Managers I have ever had. He knew exactly how to handle me. He knew when to motivate and when to encourage. He was the perfect blend you need to be an inspirational Manager. I would highly recommend him for any Managerial Sales Team.
