Let us introduce you to the Red Socks Charity, your friendly neighbourhood sock fairies! Our mission? Socking it to the lack of...well, socks!\n\nWe at Red Socks Charity have unravelled an often overlooked fact - socks are among the top items craved by shelters and organizations assisting the homeless, those at risk, and anyone needing a bit of help. And we're ready to pull our socks up and do something about it!\n\nIn our quest to warm every cold foot, we've partnered with a fantastic company, adding a dash of sock to their premises. Look out for our special sock donation bin tucked away in their location.\n\nDonating to Red Socks is a clean affair - your gently worn foot-covers will enjoy a rejuvenating industrial wash before they're redistributed to local shelters and schools. Picture a day without socks - not a pretty image, right? Cold toes, discomfort, even pain. And that's what we're trying to fix.\n\nThe bitter truth is, the world needs socks, and currently, there's a serious sock-shortage in donations. So, it's time to turn the tide!\n\nIf you're wondering how to join this sock revolution, it's as simple as liking our Facebook page and sharing our website. Spread the sock love! And remember, your time, your shares, your donations, they all make a difference. Thank you for standing toe-to-toe with us in this mission.\n\nLet's sock it to 'em, with Red Socks Charity!","logo_url":null},{"starts_at":{"day":1,"month":11,"year":2016},"ends_at":{"day":30,"month":4,"year":2018},"title":"Executive Director","cause":null,"company":"Whistler Lotto","company_linkedin_profile_url":null,"description":"Introducing the Whistler's Tonnie Tuesday - a weekly 50/50 draw that makes every other Tuesday pale in comparison! Join in and you could be shimmying away with up to a whopping $10,000. That's right - enough dough to make even a baker blush!\n\nThe best part? The more, the merrier (and richer)! The more folks jump into this fun-filled lottery, the fatter the prize pool. So shout it from the rooftops, text your friends, spam your group chats - because their involvement could be your ticket to the big win!\n\nEach week, we stir the pot of fortune - sometimes, one lucky winner gets the whole enchilada, a whole 50% of the prize pool. Other times, we split the bounty, gifting two fortunate souls a neat 25% each. We're big believers in sharing the joy!\n\nBut remember, even if Lady Luck doesn't give you a wink, there's still a silver lining. The other 50% of the winnings goes straight into making Whistler a better place, benefiting local non-profit organizations. It's a win-win, really - you're either rolling in dough or rolling up your sleeves for a good cause!\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Put your luck to the test this Tonnie Tuesday.
