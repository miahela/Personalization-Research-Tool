Michele and I have also conversed on theoretical and practical matters of her desire to further her career. I've always been impressed by Michele's know-how.  She is dedicated and sincere, applying her knowledge and experience in all her work.\r\n\r\nThe hallmark of Michele's character is her honesty and creativity. This extends from those areas where it is easily seen in relationships and business transactions, as well as in integrity of thought. She approaches any analytical task with an exacting eye that is scientific, thorough, and meticulous. This is the kind of care and concern I mean by integrity of thought.  \r\n\r\nWhen a student at Keller Graduate School of Management, Michele pursued a course of study that could serve as a model for any position or to further her education.  She has not only studied an array of specially designed human resource and business courses, but a variety of higher level math and related courses as well.\r\n\r\nMichele is one of the most pleasant persons you'll ever meet or work with.  She is forthright, but neither intimidates nor intrudes. She is genuinely friendly, team oriented, witty as well as honest. You will also be impressed with her authentic and professional manner.\r\n\r\nMIchele Hicks has my unqualified professional endorsement and my deep personal respect.  Thomas J.
