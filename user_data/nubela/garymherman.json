He brought a lot of energy to the class and has become a very good friend.  The EMBA program was not only rich in instruction, but enrichened by class participation and Gary brought his practical management experience with his participation, often keeping the instructors on their toes.  I will always value Gary's insights and humor as they added to all the classes.","Paul Wysman\n\n\n\nGary Herman and I worked at ThyssenKrupp Fabco in Windsor, Ontario.  I was the Manager of Corporate Accounting and Controlling and Gary was the Vice President, Engineering and Procurement and had also held the title of Vice President, Manufacturing.  During the period of time we worked together at ThyssenKrupp Fabco, the company experienced rapid growth and Gary was instrumental in the successful fostering and management of that growth.\r\nGary is an exceptional leader with a high level of integrity.  He encouraged top performance in his team and throughout the organization by creating a positive performance oriented team dynamic, supporting and developing his team members, and promoting an environment of innovation and positive execution.  While I have known Gary, he has exhibited a positive can-do attitude and the ability to handle conflict in a constructive manner.\r\nI value the experience of working with Gary and highly recommend him for any senior executive position such as CEO, COO, or VP.","Sean Casey\n\n\n\nI had the privilege of working with Gary at MacKay CEO Forums and have found him to be a natural leader who cares about the people he works with.  Gary is a top-notch trusted advisor and I would welcome the opportunity to work with him again.  One of the best!","Gerald Clark\n\n\n\nAs Chair of the Canadian Apprenticeship Forum (CAF) I have had the privilege to have Gary as an elected Board member of our CAF Board. Gary proudly represented British Columbia at our Board table. Gary is an engaged, positive contributor at our Board of Director meetings and has always followed through on his commitments. Gary is a national leader and an excellent spokesperson for Apprenticeship in Canada.","Jerome Rodriguez\n\n\n\nIt was a pleasure of working with Gary at the Industry Training Authority. Gary is a a passionate and committed leader consistently driving for results. His guidance was critical to transitioning the organization, recruiting of key team members and the execution of an aggressive action plan. An experienced practitioner, executive and public speaker Gary has the ability to address the \"big picture\" as well as the functional details. I recommend Gary as a expert to connect with.","Todd Jones\n\n\n\nGary is a true professional at what he does and was an excellent leader by walking the walk, not just talking about it. His vast knowledge of the industry and trades training make him a real manager that knows how its done and why. Gary sets the bar very high and challenges everyone to give 110%.  Backed with Gary's excellent support and organization, this makes his team try very hard knowing he not only cares about them, but that he is a part of them as well. I have personally learned so much from him and he always took the time to coach me through many good, and not so good situations that really helped me grow in my career. Gary is an outstanding man and it was a real pleasure to work for him, not just an ordinary boss but a true motivator to reach your personal best.","Sylvain Garneau\n\n\n\nTo whom it may concern,\r\n\r\nThis reference letter is for Mr. Gary Herman who held the position of Executive Vice President Operations for VAE Nortrak North America.\r\n\r\nMr. Herman was responsible for the operations side of the business including nine manufacturing plants throughout North America, a Central Operations department including all purchasing, and two distribution yards.\r\n\r\nGary was brought into Nortrak as my replacement when I was promoted from the EVP Operations role to CEO in 2007. The past three years have been a time of great change at Nortrak.\r\nA detailed Plant Utilization Plan that re-aligned how and where the company’s products were manufactured was rolled out by Mr. Herman.  The plan included significant capital investment in new equipment to increase the manufacturing capabilities as well as downsizing one plant and closing another. The plan was completed successfully and ahead of its three year timeline.\r\n\r\nDuring Gary’s tenure, Nortrak built a Concrete Turnout tie plant and acquired a foundry and plastics injection molding company in the US Midwest. Both of these operations also reported to him. Throughout the difficult market conditions of 2008 and 2009, the company still managed to save $3.4 million per year through a Continuous Improvement Program which Mr. Herman directed.\r\n\r\n Gary possesses an extensive manufacturing background including a sound knowledge of lean manufacturing. His diverse experience in tooling and machinery as well as project and production manufacturing were definite assets. He is a strong leader who always works toward the best outcome for the company and is not easily deterred by others.\r\n\r\nMr. Herman has chosen to leave Nortrak to pursue other opportunities. His leadership, straightforwardness and honesty will be missed.\r\n\r\nFor a company seeking a senior executive I recommend Mr. Herman in an EVP Operations role or as a COO or CEO.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Sylvain Garneau\r\nCEO\r\nVAE Nortrak\r\n16160 River Rd\r\nRichmond, BC V4A 1P8\r\nCanada\r\nPhone:\t206-310-2918\r\nEmail:\tsgarneau@nortrak.com","Jeff Heissel\n\n\n\nGary and I were members of the North American Procurement project for voestealpine NA.  Gary headed up our team whose purpose was to determine the financial benefits of leveraging the group purchasing power when obtaining capital equipment.  Gary’s organizational skills were very evident as he coordinated exercises to determine the requirements of the diverse group of companies.  Through his leadership, experience and professional approach, blanket purchasing agreements were negotiated and signed, benefiting all participating members of the voestalpine group in Canada, US and Mexico.      \r\nI confidently recommend Gary for a role as Executive VP Operations, COO, or President/CEO in a company that manufactures products or machinery and equipment."],"activities":[{"title":"Carlson Construction Group increases Industrial Construction Capability with Acquisition of Aligned Industrial Services Inc.Carlson Construction…","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join","activity_status":"Liked by Gary Herman, MBA, ICD.D"},{"title":"We're both honoured and excited to share that on Monday, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Indigenous Food Sovereignty Association…","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join","activity_status":"Liked by Gary Herman, MBA, ICD.D"},{"title":"#Canada – as the shocking and sobering events in Ukraine continue to unfold, we have an opportunity.
