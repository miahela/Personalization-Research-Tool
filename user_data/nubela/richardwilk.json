He is motivated, creative, and charismatic with everyone he meets. It’s no wonder that every project he puts his mind to turns into a success. I highly recommend him to any company seeking a professional asset, or as a mentor to anyone up and coming in the industry. Richard is the who's who of Las Vegas with numerous connections and  celebrity outreach like no other. Richard has also become a close friend during the years. He would be a great asset to any company.  ","Adam Sheldon Seid\n\n\n\nOne of the top people I have had the pleasure to work with in the nightclub and venue branding arena.
