With a Bachelor’s in Business Administration and a Master’s in Employment Relations from Memorial University of Newfoundland, I bring over 20 years of experience in Human Resources, leadership and workforce planning. I have built a progressive leadership career in Human Resources, where I have honed my skills in developing effective teams and driving organizational success. My training and career has equipped me with a deep understanding of the complex relationship between business needs and people strategy. I’ve delved deeply into pretty well all facets of HR, from strategic HR planning and leadership development to employee relations, collective bargaining and talent acquisition among much more.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve worked across industries such as healthcare, construction, energy, community services, home care and energy—gaining firsthand experience with a wide range of regulated professions and support services. This variety has taught me that no two businesses are alike, and I specialize in helping organizations identify systemic gaps, optimize performance, and create sustainable change.","country":"CA","country_full_name":"Canada","city":"Portugal Cove-Saint Philip's","state":"Newfoundland and Labrador","experiences":[{"starts_at":{"day":1,"month":9,"year":2024},"ends_at":null,"company":"Nicole Bailey Consulting","company_linkedin_profile_url":null,"company_facebook_profile_url":null,"title":"Consultant","description":null,"location":"St John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada","logo_url":null},{"starts_at":{"day":1,"month":6,"year":2022},"ends_at":{"day":30,"month":9,"year":2024},"company":"Brightisle","company_linkedin_profile_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/brightisle","company_facebook_profile_url":null,"title":"Human Resources Director","description":null,"location":"St John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada","logo_url":"https://s3.us-west-000.backblazeb2.com/proxycurl/company/brightisle/profile?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=0004d7f56a0400b0000000001%2F20240930%2Fus-west-000%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20240930T201537Z&X-Amz-Expires=1800&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=e9152146e957cab90799c31a3f5b924df782c0081dcc392a23388f7af3385374"},{"starts_at":{"day":1,"month":11,"year":2020},"ends_at":{"day":30,"month":6,"year":2022},"company":"Eastern Health","company_linkedin_profile_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/easternhealth","company_facebook_profile_url":null,"title":"Human Resources Manager (Labour Relations )","description":null,"location":null,"logo_url":"https://s3.us-west-000.backblazeb2.com/proxycurl/company/easternhealth/profile?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=0004d7f56a0400b0000000001%2F20240930%2Fus-west-000%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20240930T201537Z&X-Amz-Expires=1800&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=c04e6ac7e2bd0e395af111271b79df2c55752e866b592dd4692f3cea255003ed"},{"starts_at":{"day":1,"month":6,"year":2009},"ends_at":{"day":30,"month":11,"year":2020},"company":"Eastern Health","company_linkedin_profile_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/easternhealth","company_facebook_profile_url":null,"title":"Human Resources Consultant Lead","description":"In my current role I perform grievance management, collective agreement interpretation, workplace investigations, disability management, among various other areas of labor relations and human resources.
