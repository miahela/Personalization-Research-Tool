Current strategies represent AUM of $700M+ and members of the team have been successfully investing in the alternative space since 2007.   We prefer novel and underinvested segments of the alternative universe in which to deploy capital. We seek to access strategies that might otherwise might not be on the radar of most investors. Smaller can often be beneficial. Less financialized market segments often exhibit higher returns and better capital deployment prospects due to reduced competition and useful correlation benefits and reduced volatility when compared to more mainstream alternative asset classes.  We prefer strategies that have at their core a narrow theme with demonstrable structural growth trends. We believe such strategies tend to combine all the features we seek - niche, under-financialized, under-invested and with competitive valuations.","location":"Calgary, Alberta,
