He is tireless when working to solve issues and produces a variety of possible solutions. Larry builds very strong and co-operative relationships internally with all levels of the business and creates especially strong relationships with vendors. In my time working with Larry I found him to be a very strong negotiator and has particular strength in procurement of new products, vendors and supply contracts. He worked closely with key suppliers to ensure Nando's had the best possible products at the best price.  I Feel that any company that requires an extremely passionate manager, procurement manager or other roles to do with the building or operating of restaurants will gain from Larry’s strengths.","A more honest, reliable and considerate person you are unlikely to find.
