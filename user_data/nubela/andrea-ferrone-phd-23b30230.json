He impressed me with his ability to cheerfully embrace both complex technical problems and complex human problems. He is curious and open to new learning. ","I have known Andrea for a very long time, and the qualities that he has shown, since his early years, are surely his tenacity, persistence, honesty and determination. He is a hard worker and is very dependable.  With time, he has acquired the capability to communicate with poise and unwavering professionalism.  He is definitely an asset to any organization or company. ","Andrea and I worked together on many projects at both Menrva Research Group and Movit Technologies. In such a fast-paced research environment where resources were limited, we had to be creative with our problem-solving and our planning. His strong leadership skills, accompanied with his diverse technical background, proved to be extremely efficient in solving a multitude of complex problems we encountered. One of his strongest attributes is his ability to dive through patents and research papers to gain a sense of context in what is readily available for the problem-at-hand.","Andrea was my project manager for around 7 months and he did a great job helping to prioritize and distribute tasks among members of our team. Keeping the bigger picture in view was critical to timely achievement of our goals in the limited time-frame we had, and Andrea did a great job keeping us focused on what mattered. His strong engineering background made discussing technical details with him engaging and productive (in contrast to a typical manager/engineer dynamic).","Andrea is a powerful team leader and an extremely knowledgeable engineer. He has a multitude of experiences several industries (biomedical, material science, wearables, and electronics) and brings a very unique and powerful range of experiences to any problem he tackles. He has managed teams and guided them to solve complex problems. He is continuously learning and applying agile and scrum methodologies to maximize team productivity and efficiency. He is a highly recommended addition to any team."],"activities":[{"title":"Photo","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join","activity_status":"Shared by Andrea Ferrone, PhD"},{"title":"Thanks so much for the support and shout-out BC Tech!
