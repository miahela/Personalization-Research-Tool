I'm Naomi Betancourt and I am currently a full-time Partnerships Manager at Per Scholas, part-time Rutgers Business student, and a freelance fashion photographer! My career is mixed with a technical, analytical, and creative background. \n\nI am eager to contribute to my community by working in a role that involves teaching and assisting individuals in underserved areas. I am committed to providing my community with the necessary knowledge and resources to improve the skills of my loved ones and acquaintances. I find it fulfilling to work in both corporate and nonprofit sectors because it allows me to demonstrate the potential for career growth with my current experience. I place a high value on being a valuable asset to my team and potentially leading my team to expand the support we offer. Additionally, I am attentive to details and able to identify steps to minimize risks and enhance efficiency.\n\nAs a former volunteer for the Alumni Board Committee of Year Up, I served as the Board Chair and had a team of four members. It was my first experience in a role that involved handling a business credit card for event expenses. To ensure smooth communication and coordination among the team, I created a community hub system on Notion that notified the members about new meetings, event planning, financial coordination, and resource channels. Together with my team, we successfully planned and managed four events, with their assistance in the Marketing, Operations, and Finance areas. I conducted biweekly meetings to review our progress, assess our strengths and weaknesses for the month, share new ideas for upcoming events, and celebrate our achievements.\n\nSkills: Partnerships
