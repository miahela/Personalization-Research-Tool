She is the Founder and Chief Innovation Officer of FemHealth Insights, Host of the FemTech Focus Podcast, Co-Founder of Coyote Ventures, Advisory Board Member for Johnson Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation at Indiana University, and an unconventional scientist, entrepreneur, and consultant that proves that anything is possible with hard work and heart. \n\nHer journey in women's health began as a distributor and educator for Athena's Home Novelties (SexTech). She has engaged in HHMI-funded research on potential correlations between Estrogen and Alzheimer's, which disproportionately affects women. While finishing her doctorate in Genetics, she founded a venture-backed startup, Pheramor, the world's first DNA-based dating app. The algorithm incorporated factors that increase sexual compatibility and fertility between matches. Dr. Barreto also co-founded WeHaveChemistry, a web-based product for couples to discover their love alchemy. She exited the two companies and shifted into investments as Senior Venture Associate and launched Capital Factory's Gulf Coast branch. Under Dr. Barreto’s leadership, the Houston accelerator portfolio grew by an impressive 205%. \n\nDr. Barreto noticed how underserved the women's health (femtech) industry was and set out to bring awareness, resources, and capital to it. She hosts the #1 femtech podcast, FemTech Focus, co-founded an early-stage femtech investment firm, Coyote Ventures, and founded FemHealth Insights, a boutique consulting firm with a market research software tool specializing in women's health innovation. She is considered the voice of femtech and is a 3x recipient of Top Leaders in FemTech. Dr. Barreto has served on women’s health committees with Gates Foundation, NIH, and HLTH. She is a FemTech Forbes contributor and hosts a tech column in HealthyWomen magazine. She is invited internationally to speak on the past, present, and future of women’s health innovation.

Stress-inducible mutagenesis mechanisms may provide important models for mutagenesis that drives host-pathogen interactions, antibiotic resistance, and possibly much of evolution generally.  In Escherichia coli, repair of DNA double-strand breaks is switched to a mutagenic mode, using error-prone DNA polymerases, via the SOS DNA-damage and the general (σS) stress responses. We investigated small RNA (sRNA) clients of RNA chaperone Hfq, which promotes mutagenic break repair (MBR), and found that GcvB promotes MBR by allowing a robust σS response, achieved via opposing the membrane stress (σE) response.  First, cells that lack gcvB were MBR-deficient in two standard assays.  Second, ∆gcvB cells displayed reduced σS-dependent transcription in colony and flow-cytometric assays, but not reduced σS-protein levels.  Third, the σS-dependent-transcription and MBR defects of ∆gcvB cells were alleviated by deletion of rssB, which increases σS levels.  These data imply that GcvB promotes mutagenesis by allowing a normal σS response.  Fourth, ∆gcvB cells were highly induced for the σE response.  Moreover, their high σE response underlies their reduced MBR, in that a special σE-response-blocking mutation restored mutagenesis to ∆gcvB cells.  We suggest that GcvB may promote the σS response and mutagenesis indirectly, by promoting membrane integrity, which keeps σE levels lower. At high levels, σE might inhibit σS-dependent transcription by titrating RNA polymerase, to which σS would normally bind, so that σS may be unable to regulate transcription at the normal level. The data show the delicate balance of stress-response modulation of mutagenesis. ","url":null},{"name":"Double-Strand-Break Repair, Mutagenesis and Stress.
