When I first began working from home full-time in 2012, there were very few resources or studies focusing on how remote work affects mental and physical health. In fact, most of the books and resources I found centered around how to remain productive as a remote worker with little to no acknowledgement of the toll telecommuting takes on one's well-being. \n\nLike millions of people across the globe who became overnight telecommuters, I became a fully remote worker unexpectedly. The difference is that I had to figure out how to regain and protect my mental health by myself due to the paucity of resources, support, and compassion at the time. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic changed all of that, as an unprecedented number of studies regarding the effects of teleworking on health were published in 2020, 2021, and 2022. This book compiles the data collected during these times along with my personal anecdotes and trial-and-error solutions.","location":"Now available on

Pandhe, PhD\n\n\n\nI have had the pleasure of knowing Frieda for the past year and recently had the opportunity to witness her expertise firsthand at a virtual event hosted by HBA DFW. Frieda delivered an insightful and impactful presentation on the topic of \"Breaking Crazy: The impact of remote and hybrid work on mental health.\"\n\nHer presentation was exceptionally well-received by attendees, who found immense value in the content she shared. Frieda's ability to articulate complex concepts surrounding mental health challenges in the United States, as well as the specific impact of remote and hybrid work on mental, emotional, and physical well-being, was truly remarkable.\n\nWhat stood out most was Frieda's practical approach, as she provided attendees with actionable strategies that they could immediately implement in their day-to-day lives. From maximizing time management and productivity to prioritizing overall health, Frieda equipped participants with the tools they need to thrive in today's evolving work landscape.\n\nAs a pharmacist-turned-medical writer and journalist with an impressive portfolio, including contributions to publications such as O, The Oprah Magazine, and WebMD, Frieda brings a unique blend of expertise to her presentations. Her extensive research on the effects of remote work on health, coupled with her firsthand experience as a telecommuter for over a decade, lends credibility and depth to her insights.\n\nFurthermore, Frieda's dedication to shedding light on important issues extends beyond her work in mental health and remote work. Her upcoming projects, including her work on children's books highlighting trailblazing figures such as Victoria Woodhull, Charlene Mitchell, and Patsy Mink, underscore her commitment to amplifying underrepresented voices and driving meaningful change.\n\nIn summary, Frieda Wiley, PharmD, is not only a highly knowledgeable and engaging speaker but also a passionate advocate for mental health and social progress. I highly recommend her as a speaker and look forward to witnessing her continued impact in the field.","Kristin Speer, PharmD, BCPS\n\n\n\nExtraordinary companies find extraordinary ways to partner with extraordinary humans. If you're considering Dr. Wiley, she's one of those humans.\n\nI have been following and admiring Dr. Wiley's work for almost 4 years now. Dr. Wiley's exceptional background as an aerospace chemist turned clinical pharmacist, writer, researcher, speaker, and consultant uniquely positions her as a stellar communicator--not just a writer. Her authentic, vulnerable, and empathetic approach, combined with a track record of excellence across various topics, channels and media, makes her a captivating and motivating force. From technical and scientific articles to speaker appearances on podcasts, radio and TV shows, to children's books (she's about to publish 3), Dr. Wiley's rare degree of brilliance and flexibility shine through. With an uncanny ability to tailor content for any audience, I believe Dr. Wiley's value would be best leveraged not by applying her mastery but sharing with others how she does it.  \n\nI highly recommend her for speaking, training, or consulting roles to help organizations optimize their language and content for any audience. Whether she returns to aerospace or ventures into new realms, Dr. Wiley's unparalleled communication skills will undoubtedly make a monumental impact wherever she lands."],"activities":[],"similarly_named_profiles":[],"articles":[],"groups":[{"profile_pic_url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E07AQEa70OD5D_BOg/group-logo_image-shrink_400x400/group-logo_image-shrink_400x400/0/1631006223507?e=1726779600&v=beta&t=Z3PZCmcJDerPSX-06BXdkBnme1JWV8l7DCVvn1ClStY","name":"Consultant Connection with Elaine Biech & Halelly Azulay","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12400182"},{"profile_pic_url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C5607AQE-J-WE5lpu1w/group-logo_image-shrink_48x48/group-logo_image-shrink_48x48/0/1631010453675?e=1726779600&v=beta&t=2pshaXizn47fSJz-8fCG4fDik58eApO3WE1BSQphB18","name":"Neuroscience Research, Discovery & Therapeutics","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/groups/6569738"}],"skills":[],"inferred_salary":null,"gender":null,"birth_date":null,"industry":"Public Relations & Communications","extra":null,"interests":[],"personal_emails":[],"personal_numbers":[]}
