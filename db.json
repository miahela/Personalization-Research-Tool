Stress-inducible mutagenesis mechanisms may provide important models for mutagenesis that drives host-pathogen interactions, antibiotic resistance, and possibly much of evolution generally.  In Escherichia coli, repair of DNA double-strand breaks is switched to a mutagenic mode, using error-prone DNA polymerases, via the SOS DNA-damage and the general (\u03c3S) stress responses. We investigated small RNA (sRNA) clients of RNA chaperone Hfq, which promotes mutagenic break repair (MBR), and found that GcvB promotes MBR by allowing a robust \u03c3S response, achieved via opposing the membrane stress (\u03c3E) response.  First, cells that lack gcvB were MBR-deficient in two standard assays.  Second, \u2206gcvB cells displayed reduced \u03c3S-dependent transcription in colony and flow-cytometric assays, but not reduced \u03c3S-protein levels.  Third, the \u03c3S-dependent-transcription and MBR defects of \u2206gcvB cells were alleviated by deletion of rssB, which increases \u03c3S levels.  These data imply that GcvB promotes mutagenesis by allowing a normal \u03c3S response.  Fourth, \u2206gcvB cells were highly induced for the \u03c3E response.  Moreover, their high \u03c3E response underlies their reduced MBR, in that a special \u03c3E-response-blocking mutation restored mutagenesis to \u2206gcvB cells.  We suggest that GcvB may promote the \u03c3S response and mutagenesis indirectly, by promoting membrane integrity, which keeps \u03c3E levels lower. At high levels, \u03c3E might inhibit \u03c3S-dependent transcription by titrating RNA polymerase, to which \u03c3S would normally bind, so that \u03c3S may be unable to regulate transcription at the normal level. The data show the delicate balance of stress-response modulation of mutagenesis. ", "url": null}, {"name": "Double-Strand-Break Repair, Mutagenesis and Stress.

He's very detail-oriented and is always looking for ways to make a project better. He communicates well, asks questions to make sure everyone is on the same page, and is great at taking feedback. He's always looking for ways to improve the sound quality of what he's working on, going above and beyond to make his deliverables are as good as they can be. He's got a great ear for dialogue and podcast editing and is skilled at mixing and mastering. He's a wonderful addition to any project or team.", "Ilana Landsberg-Lewis (she/her)\n\n\n\nAndy jumped in to edit audio on my Podcast with great insight, skill, and attentiveness to detail. He is a terrific listener and collaborator, making his timely contributions all the more valuable and professionally executed. A real pleasure to work with!\"", "Gina Fontanini\n\n\n\nAndy Bosnak is a leading and dedicated media artist, project manager, sound engineer, and educator. I worked with Andy Bosnak for nearly 4 years at Music Industry Workshop/Studio Chicago. His knowledge of sound recording, technical studio projects, and media production are unparalleled along with his leadership. Andy has a proven track record teaching and empowering others with thoroughness and patience specifically in the visual and sound sectors, having a specialized focus on technology.   Proving to be a professional collaborator, Andy is extremely open-minded and has demonstrated the skills to tackle issues with leadership, encouragement, and support to those he works with. I have seen Andy tackle technical as well as managerial obstacles with patience and efficiency, proving measurable progress. Working with him has taught me not only audio and visual technical skills but also inclusivity, patience, and the increasing value of pride in the workplace. Andy has always been a thoughtful team player with excellent technical capabilities in sound engineering, podcast recording, educational training, and audio management skills. Andy's personal empathy towards others makes him a great listener and educator. He collaboratively solves problems, works through issues, executes on deadlines, demonstrates the finest technical abilities, and leads by example.", "Bill Baykan\n\n\n\nAndy is a terrific colleague and educator.  It was a pleasure working with him at Flashpoint College, where he taught both production and theory classes with equal facility.  Students benefited from his positive energy and understanding, as well as his subject matter expertise.  We look forward to working with Andy again soon.", "Tim Yamaya\n\n\n\nI had the pleasure of working with Andy while teaching at the School of Audio Engineering in Chicago. We worked together to develop the curriculum for a new class. We had never worked together before, and were given short lead times to create content and have it ready for consumption.  Andy is great collaborator - his ability to both drive communications and actively listen to feedback made him a great partner to work with. His personality and technical expertise in audio enabled us to meet tight deadlines in a creative area where there were a lot of different ways that the final product could have taken shape. He also proved to be a genuine, natural teacher with the ability to connect to people across a diverse set of backgrounds. ", "John Klein\n\n\n\nAndy and I have had the pleasure of going through DePaul's MFA program in the School of Cinematic Arts together, and we've also worked together on several short films now, in various capacities. Every time, without question, he's been such a phenomenal presence both on and off set, whether it's his work in post-production audio or even as an assistant director.  While I haven't seen him teach, I know his students appreciate the heck out of him, and his vast knowledge across all parts of the filmmaking process has served him well as both a professor and as a storyteller.  He's professional, easygoing yet organized and methodical, and his strong work ethic means that when Andy's around, stuff gets done, and done well.  Plus, he's just a good all-around dude, and I'm happy to call him both my collaborator and friend.  ", "Chris Chapoy\n\n\n\nI was fortunate enough to have Andy as a professor and later on a co-worker. He is honest, hard working, determined, caring, humble and so much more. As an educator he motivated me to be better and always inspired me to work harder. As a co-worker he gave me countless opportunities as Andy wants others to succeed as he has. He has mentored me and helped me grow in both my professional and personal life. I hope to work again with Andy in the future but most importantly, I know that I have a genuine lifelong friend. ", "James Auwarter\n\n\n\nI consider myself lucky to have worked alongside Andy since 2014. At that time, I personally was brand new to the teaching world. Without hesitation, Andy showed me the ropes, and he was instrumental in helping me develop into a good educator. This became a reoccurring theme; seeing him make a lasting impact on both colleagues, as well as students.\n\nAndy\u2019s passions for teaching, music, audio, and film are apparent to anyone whom he meets. When it comes to audio post production questions, Andy remains at the top of my call-list. His dedication to this craft is inspiring, and his talent distinct.  I\u2019ve often witnessed him bring a unique perspective to professional scenarios, while still always remaining the ultimate team-player. Andy is simply a great guy to work with and to be around: he\u2019s smart, well-spoken, honest, and hard-working. Any time this guy calls, I pick up\u2014and, that sums it up.", "Geoffrey Smeltzer\n\n\n\nI've had the pleasure of working with Andy a few times over the past two years and I have always been impressed by his knowledge, preparedness, and conscientiousness. I saw those skills first hand as he has helped me complete my film projects as both an\u00a0Audio Editor and as my First Assistant Director. Both jobs require a high level of collaboration and attention to detail.\n\nI was able to stay on task as a director on set because\u00a0of\u00a0Andy. He facilitated communications with all of the members of a 20 plus person film crew.\u00a0 Everyone on set made it known that they felt heard and appreciated and that in my mind is thanks to Andy. Specifically I can think of one instance where there was an issue on set where a makeup artist was unwilling to listen to an actor's advice as to how to best handle her skin tone. Andy advised me on the best way to handle the conflict without anyone getting their feelings hurt or causing any further costly delay to our production.\u00a0With his help we always managed to complete all of our shots even under a tight schedule.\nAs an Audio Editor has he always taken the initiative to ask questions and always completed his work on deadline. I found him to be very skilled and knowledgable\u00a0in all aspects of Audio Editing and Post Production. Whenever I had questions for him during our time working in post-production audio Andy was always there to patiently answer my questions and help me grow to become a more well-rounded artist and Director.\n\nWhen I required extra help on a project Andy was able to call on a network of collaborators that were more than willing to work with me on his recommendation alone. I think that kind of trust and loyalty says a lot about how a person conducts themselves.\u00a0", "Charles Mueller, MFA\n\n\n\nAndy was technically able and aesthetically engaged. As a producer writer and director I was always impressed with Andy\u2019s understanding of both budget, time, and quality.
